Experimenting with analyzing the screen. I was hoping the indiviual buttons were available using Windows standard APIs but 
they don't seem to be. Having a picture of each button seems to be the way. Need to work out how best capture these images.

It may be better to allow a calling mechanism in pyPoB to allow a test module to request pyPoB to select wigets and report on their status (enabled/disabled/visible/hidden/checked, etc)
