Extract it somewhere you can find it again. EG: c:\Python311

Add this location to your path, in Win10/11 this has been buried in settings, so maybe use powershell (option 1):
Option 1) Right click on start anda select 'Terminal (Admin)' or 'Powershell (Admin)'. 
Add two paths. The main python directory and the scripts directory.
Run
	$env:Path = 'C:\Python311;C:\Python311\Scripts;' + $env:Path
Option 2) Open Settings, Click on System
Scroll down to About.
On the right hand side, under "Related Settings" (Win11 is "Related Links"), select "Advanced System Settings"
	This will popup a system properties window, with the "Advanced" tab selected
Select the "Environment Variables..." button near the bottom of this window
Add two paths. The main python directory and the scripts directory
EG:
	C:\Python311\
	C:\Python311\Scripts\

Open a command prompt and change directory to where you cloned PathofBuilding

Python 3.12
Download https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.2/python-3.12.2-amd64.exe
Extract it somewhere you can find it again. EG: c:\Python312

Changing python versions
------------------------
Whenever you change dependencies by hand in your pyproject.toml you have to take care of these points:

    Run poetry lock --no-update afterwards. The reasons for this is, that poetry install takes the poetry.lock as input if can find one and not the pyproject.toml.

    If you change the python version, remove the .venv before running poetry install. poetry doesn't change the python version of a venv once it is created, because it uses the python version itself to create the virtualenv.
