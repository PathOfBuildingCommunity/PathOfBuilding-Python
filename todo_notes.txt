when adding items, translate Node x,y into setOffset

TreeGraphicsItem.setPixmap(node.sprites(f"{node.type}{node.active}")

Find where to put switch_class in

limit zoom (0.5 -> 0.08)


function DrawImage(imgHandle, left, top, width, height, tcLeft, tcTop, tcRight, tcBottom) end

Does writing json(loadstring()) work

Try add toolbar to Tree Tab
Add widgets to main Toolbar manually as QT designer won't do it.

Promote graphicsview to my treeview
Edit: For those trying to do this in the future, make sure that when you put in the python file into the header input, you don't put the .py at the end, as it literally takes that letter for letter and converts it to an import statement when you convert the ui to a py file.
